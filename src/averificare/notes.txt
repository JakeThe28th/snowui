TODO:

			 Rounded Rectangles
			 	- maybe, draw the outsides of the corners as stencils
			 	  and then just draw a normal rectangle?
			 			  
			 	  would need to add a new draw mode (for stenciling)
			 	  which would just draw to the stencil buffer or something
			 	  
			 	  
			 	  actually no
			 	  
			 	  in the shader, i'll add uniforms with a multiplier for x and y, and
			 	  then multiply the texture coordinate by that, and then check the 
			 	  distance from the corner texture coordinate to discard the fragment
			 	  
			 	  the shader gets recompiled when rounded corners are enabled/disabled,
			 	  so if they're off, the shader won't have them at all
			 	  
			 	  maybe make a custom shader class extending glshader program with
			 	  	set fade min max X
			 	  	set rounded corners true false
			 	  	etc?
			 	  			
			also,
			 clickableDot and clickableRectangle to allow for
			 scroll bar and slider dot styling
